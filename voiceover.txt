==========================================
COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
==========================================

1. MONOTONE DELIVERY
   - Vary pitch, pace, and energy throughout
   - Use vocal dynamics to maintain interest

2. RUSHING THROUGH TIME STAMPS
   - Honor the pacing guides
   - Don't speed up just to fit time

3. ROBOTIC LIST READING
   - Each item should have personality
   - Add micro-pauses between list items

4. IGNORING EMPHASIS MARKERS
   - Emphasized words carry key information
   - Use volume, pitch, or pacing to highlight them

5. FORGETTING TO BREATHE
   - Natural breath breaks prevent gasping
   - Pauses add dramatic effect

6. INCONSISTENT ENERGY
   - Match energy to content emotional arc
   - High energy for benefits, empathy for problems

7. SOUNDING SCRIPTED
   - Practice until it feels conversational
   - Add natural filler words if it helps (um, you know - sparingly)

==========================================
POST-PRODUCTION NOTES
==========================================

EDITING:
- Remove mouth clicks and breaths between sentences
- Normalize audio levels to -14 LUFS for YouTube
- Apply gentle compression (3:1 ratio)
- De-ess sibilant sounds
- Add subtle room tone in gaps

MUSIC DUCKING:
- Background music should duck to -25dB when voice is present
- Return to -15dB during transitions
- Fade out completely during important emphasis moments

PACING ADJUSTMENTS:
- If running long, cut transitional phrases first
- If running short, add micro-pauses for emphasis
- Never rush delivery to fit time

==========================================

MUSIC EDITING & IMPLEMENTATION TIPS
========================================

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**File Format**: WAV or FLAC (highest quality)
**Sample Rate**: 48kHz (matches video)
**Bit Depth**: 24-bit minimum
**Normalization**: Peak at -6dB to prevent clipping

### EDITING WORKFLOW

1. **Import & Sync**: Import all music tracks, sync to video timeline
2. **Level Setting**: Set base levels according to section recommendations
3. **Ducking Setup**: Create audio ducking automation tied to voiceover
4. **Crossfades**: Add 2-4 second crossfades between music sections
5. **Emphasis Moments**: Manually adjust levels for key emphasis points
6. **Final Mix**: Ensure music never competes with voice for attention

### COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Too Loud**: Music should enhance, not overpower voice
❌ **Abrupt Changes**: Jarring music transitions break immersion
❌ **Repetitive**: Same energy level throughout becomes monotonous
❌ **Wrong Mood**: Music that doesn't match content emotion
❌ **No Ducking**: Music competing with important information
❌ **Poor Quality**: Low-bitrate music sounds unprofessional

### ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

✅ **EQ Shaping**: High-pass filter music at 80Hz to avoid voice conflict
✅ **Sidechain Compression**: Professional ducking tied to voice levels
✅ **Parallel Compression**: Maintain music presence while ducking
✅ **Harmonic Content**: Choose music keys that complement voice tone
✅ **Rhythmic Alignment**: Sync music beats to edit cuts when possible
